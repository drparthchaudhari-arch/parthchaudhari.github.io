                    <li><strong>Age:</strong> 5 years</li>

                <h2>History</h2>
                <p>
                    The patient is a Holstein cow in her third lactation, approximately 75 days in milk. Farm staff noted sudden reduction in milk
                    yield from the left rear quarter with watery milk containing flakes and clots. The cow was mildly off feed at morning check and
                    stood apart from the herd during milking.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Bedding in the free-stall barn was recently changed after a period of wet weather. No recent dry-off therapy errors were recorded,
                    but teat-end hygiene compliance has varied among staff on evening shifts. Two other cows in the same pen had subclinical mastitis
                    flagged by elevated somatic cell counts in the past month.

                <h2>Diagnosis and Treatment</h2>
                <p>
                    The case was classified as clinical mastitis based on quarter-specific inflammation and abnormal milk secretion. A California Mastitis
                    Test was strongly positive in the affected quarter, and milk culture was submitted to guide targeted antimicrobial selection and improve
                    stewardship decisions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Immediate management included frequent stripping/milking of the affected quarter, NSAID therapy for inflammation and comfort, and
                    intramammary treatment according to farm protocol pending culture results. Staff were instructed to tighten pre- and post-milking teat
                    disinfection workflow and isolate equipment used on clinical cases.

                <h2>Key Learning Points</h2>
                <ul class="pc-findings">
                    <li>Quarter-level milk changes plus udder inflammation are core indicators of clinical mastitis.</li>
                    <li>Culture-guided therapy supports better outcomes and reduces unnecessary antimicrobial use.</li>
                    <li>Environmental hygiene and milking routine consistency are major herd-level prevention levers.</li>
                    <li>Tracking SCC trends helps identify subclinical spread before overt clinical outbreaks.</li>
